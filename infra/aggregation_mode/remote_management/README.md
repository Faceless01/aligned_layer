This files are supposed to be used in case we want to manage the process using a second server who starts the GPU server using a timer.

It is useful to avoid being charged for the time the GPU server is not used.

As the GPU stock is limited we are keeping the GPU server running all the time, but in case we want to use it only when needed, we can use this scripts to start and stop the GPU server using a timer.
