# Aligned SDK

## API Reference for aggregation mode

### `is_proof_verified_in_aggregation_mode`

Checks if the proof has been verified with Aligned Aggregation Mode.

```rust
pub async fn is_proof_verified_in_aggregation_mode(
    verification_data: AggregationModeVerificationData,
    network: Network,
    eth_rpc_url: &str
    beacon_client_url: &str,
    from_block: Option<u64>
) -> Result<[u8; 32], ProofVerificationAggModeError>
```

#### Arguments

-   `verification_data` - The verification data needed based on the provided proving system.
-   `network` - The network on which the verification will be done (`devnet | holesky | mainnet`)
-   `eth_rpc_url` - The URL of the Ethereum RPC node.

#### Returns

-   `Result<[u8; 32], ProofVerificationAggModeError>` - The merkle root of the aggregated proof.

#### Errors

-   `ProvingSystemNotSupportedInAggMode` if the proving system is not supported (Currently, only SP1 compressed proofs are supported).
-   `EthereumProviderError` if there is an error in the Ethereum call.
-   `BeaconClient` if there is an error in the Beacon client call.
-   `UnmatchedBlobAndEventMerkleRoot` if the proof was in included in the blob but the merkle root did not match with the one in the contract
-   `ProofNotFoundInLogs` if the proof was not found in any of the aggregated proofs from the specified block_number
-   `EventDecoding`: if it failed to decode an event from the ProofAggregationService
